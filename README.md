# Solana Automated Market Maker (AMM)

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Solana-based Automated Market Maker (AMM) implementation designed to provide decentralized liquidity and token swapping functionality on the Solana blockchain. The project offers a robust, flexible, and secure solution for creating and managing liquidity pools, swapping tokens, and managing rewards.

Key features include:
- Advanced liquidity management
- Flexible pool creation and configuration
- Support for multiple token types (including Token22)
- Reward mechanisms for liquidity providers
- Sophisticated swap routing and calculation mechanisms

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Rust
- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Build Tools**: 
  - Cargo
  - Anchor Framework
- **Key Libraries**:
  - Solana Program Library (SPL)
  - Custom mathematical libraries for precise calculations

## Core Features

### Liquidity Management
- Create and manage liquidity pools
- Increase/decrease liquidity with advanced mathematical calculations
- Support for concentrated liquidity positions

### Token Swapping
- Flexible swap mechanisms
- Support for multiple token types
- Efficient routing and price calculation

### Reward System
- Initialize and set reward parameters
- Collect and distribute rewards to liquidity providers
- Flexible reward configuration

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Pool
```rust
// Example of creating an AMM pool (pseudo-code)
create_pool(
    token_a,
    token_b,
    fee_tier,
    initial_price
)
```

### Swapping Tokens
```rust
// Example of performing a token swap
swap(
    input_token,
    output_token,
    amount_in,
    minimum_amount_out
)
```
